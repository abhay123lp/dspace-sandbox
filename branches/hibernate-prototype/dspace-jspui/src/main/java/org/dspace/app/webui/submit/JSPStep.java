/**
 * Interface for DSpace Submission Steps which use the JSP UI.
 * <P>
 * These methods revolve around the following: (1) pre-processing of data to
 * prepare for display, (2) displaying data on JSP, and (3) processing of any
 * user input (or alternatively backend processing, for non-interactive steps).
 * <P>
 * For the JSP UI, the job of this class is to maintain the context of where the
 * user is within the current "step" of the submission process. Each "step" can
 * consist of multiple "pages" (which roughly correspond to HTML displays), so
 * this class helps manage which page the user should see next.
 * <P>
 * The methods of the JSPStepManager are called in this order:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Call doPreProcessing() method</li>
 * <li>If showJSP() was specified from doPreProcessing(), then the JSP
 * specified will be displayed</li>
 * <li>If showJSP() was not specified from doPreProcessing(), then the
 * doProcessing() method is called an the step completes immediately</li>
 * <li>Call doProcessing() method after the user returns from the JSP, in order
 * to process the user input</li>
 * <li>Call doPostProcessing() method to determine if more user interaction is
 * required, and if further JSPs need to be called.</li>
 * <li>If there are more "pages" in this step then, the process begins again
 * (for the new page).</li>
 * <li>Once all pages are complete, control is forwarded back to the
 * SubmissionController, and the next step is called.</li>
 * </ul>
